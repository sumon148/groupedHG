Description: The package estimates the probability mass function (PMF) for the grouped hypergeometric (HG) distribution under imperfect tests. It calculates derivatives of the PMF with respect to the number of contaminated items (\eqn{T_x}), accounting for item- and group-level sensitivity and specificity. The package also supports calculations assuming a binomial approximation of the grouped HG distribution.
