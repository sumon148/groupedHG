\title{Probability Mass Function for Grouped Binomial Distribution under item-level imperfect Test}
\usage{
pmf_bn_item_imperfect(ty, Tx, b, barN, N, delta, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{ty}{Numeric. The number of groups where the target outcome is observed.}

\item{Tx}{Numeric. The number of target individuals in the population.}

\item{b}{Numeric. The total number of groups.}

\item{barN}{Numeric. The average number of individuals per group.}

\item{N}{Numeric. The total population size.}

\item{delta}{Numeric. The group-level false negative rate, which is the probability that a positive case is classified as negative.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric. The group-level false positive rate, which is the probability that a negative case is classified as positive.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The probability mass function (PMF) for the given group-level parameters.
}
\description{
Computes the probability mass function (PMF) for a grouped Binomial distribution
under the assumption of item-level imperfect test (false positives or false negatives).
