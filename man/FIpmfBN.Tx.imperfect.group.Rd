\title{Fisher Information for Grouped Binomial (Group-level Imperfect Case)}
\usage{
FIpmfBN.Tx.imperfect.group(Tx, b, barN, N, delta, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tx}{Numeric. The number of target individuals in the population.}

\item{b}{Numeric. The total number of groups.}

\item{barN}{Numeric. The average number of individuals per group.}

\item{N}{Numeric. The total population size.}

\item{delta}{Numeric. The group-level false negative rate, which is the probability that a positive case is classified as negative.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric. The group-level false positive rate, which is the probability that a negative case is classified as positive.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The Fisher information for the grouped binomial distribution in the imperfect case. If the parameters lead to special conditions such as \( Tx = 0 \) or numerical instability, the function returns 0 and prints a corresponding message.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Fisher information for a grouped binomial distribution in the imperfect case,
where both false positive and false negative rates are taken into account at the group level.
}
\details{
The Fisher information in the imperfect case incorporates both false positive and false negative rates. It is computed using the given parameters and is derived from the formula provided in Equation 29.
Special handling is included for the case where \( Tx = 0 \) or when numerical instability occurs due to small denominator values. In these cases, the Fisher information is set to 0 and a message is printed.

\examples{
# Example calculation for valid parameters
FIpmfBN.Tx.imperfect.group(Tx = 10, b = 5, barN = 50, N = 1000, delta = 0.1, lambda = 0.05)

# Example when Tx = 0
FIpmfBN.Tx.imperfect.group(Tx = 0, b = 5, barN = 50, N = 1000, delta = 1, lambda = 1)
